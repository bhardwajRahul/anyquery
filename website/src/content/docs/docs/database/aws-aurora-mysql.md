Anyquery is able to run queries from MySQL wire-compatible databases, such as AWS Aurora. This is useful when you want to import/export data from/to an AWS Aurora database. Or when you want to join an API with an AWS Aurora database.

## Connection

To connect an AWS Aurora database to Anyquery, you need to provide the connection string. It has the following format:

```txt
user:password@tcp(domain.svc.aurora.amazonaws.com:3306)/database?tls=true
```

You can find the hostname in the AWS Aurora console. Go to the `Connectivity & security` tab, and find the `Endpoint` field. Your username is `admin` by default.<br>
Your password is either the one you set up when creating the database or the one generated by AWS that you can find in the `Secrets manager` service.
To connect from your local machine, you need to set access to `publicly accessible` by clicking on `Modify`. And then, click on the security group and add a new rule with your IP address. <br>

Don't forget to replace the database name in the connection string.

Then, create a new connection using the following command:

```bash
anyquery connection add
```

Refer to the [MySQL guide](../mysql) for more information about the different parameters.
