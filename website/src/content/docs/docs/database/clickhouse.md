Anyquery is able to run queries from ClickHouse databases. This is useful when you want to import/export data from/to a ClickHouse database. Or when you want to join an API with a ClickHouse database.

## Connection

To connect a ClickHouse database to Anyquery, you need to provide the connection string. The connection string is a URL that contains the necessary information to connect to the database. The connection string has the following format:

```txt
clickhouse://username:password@host:port/database?param1=value1&param2=value2
```

For example: `clickhouse:mypassword@127.0.0.1:9000/default`. Refer to the [DSN documentation](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go#dsn) for more information.

To add a ClickHouse connection, use the following command:

```bash
anyquery connection add
```

The CLI will ask you for a connection name, the type of the connection (ClickHouse), and the connection string. You can also provide a filter to import only the tables you need.

- The connection name is used to reference the connection in the queries. For example, if you name the connection `ClickHouse`, you can reference the tables and views from the connection with `clickhouse.my_table`.
- The connection string is the URL to the ClickHouse database. See above for the format.
- The filter is a CEL script that filters the tables and views to import. For example, to import only the tables that start with `my_`, you can use the following filter: `table.name.startsWith("my_")`. If you don't want to filter the tables, you can leave this field empty. Refer to the [CEL syntax documentation](cel-script) for more information.

Press enter to add the connection. On the next startup, Anyquery will fetch the list of tables and views from the database and import them automatically.

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰! You can now run queries on the tables and views from the ClickHouse database. The table name will follow this format `connection_name.[schema_name]_table_name` (e.g. `clickhouse.information_schema_tables`)

```sql
-- Join a table from ClickHouse with a table from an API
SELECT * 
FROM clickhouse.my_table m
JOIN github_stargazers_from_repository('julien040/anyquery') g
ON m.id = g.login

-- Insert data into a ClickHouse table
INSERT INTO clickhouse.my_table (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');

-- List all tables of the connection
SELECT * FROM clickhouse.information_schema_tables;
```

## Additional information

### Functions

When querying a ClickHouse database, functions aren't passed to the ClickHouse server. Instead, they are executed in the SQLite database. It might often result in a performance hit. To avoid this, you can create a view in ClickHouse that computes the function and then query the view in Anyquery.

### Performance

ClickHouse is designed for high performance. While this integration tries to transfer the least amount of data possible, any query that requires a join or a WHERE invoquing a function will result in all the rows transferred to Anyquery, which can be slow. To mitigate this, you can create views in ClickHouse that pre-compute the necessary data and then query those views in Anyquery.

### Update/Delete support

ClickHouse does not require a primary key for tables. This conflicts with the data model used by Anyquery, which requires a primary key to reference rows in a table, and later update or delete them. As a result, Anyquery does not support updating or deleting rows in ClickHouse tables. You can still insert new rows.

Pull requests are welcome to add support for this feature, as I don't see a workaround for this limitation.

### Types

ClickHouse supports a wide range of types. Anyquery will try to map the types to the closest equivalent in SQLite. Integers are converted to `INT`, floating point numbers to `DOUBLE`, and strings to `TEXT`. Maps, arrays, tuples and JSON are converted to `JSON`. Refer to the [JSON documentation](/docs/usage/working-with-arrays-objects-json) for more information on how to work with JSON in Anyquery. Nested types are converted to a column for each field in the nested type. Enums are converted to `TEXT`. Dates and datetimes are converted to `DATETIME` using the `RFC3339` format.
