DuckDB is a columnar SQL OLAP database. It is designed for analytical queries and is optimized for performance. Anyquery provides a way to connect to a DuckDB database (starting from 0.4.3) and run queries on it, benefiting from its speed.

## Getting started

<Aside type='caution'>
  To work, the DuckDB CLI must be installed and available in your `PATH`. You can install it from the [DuckDB website](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/).
</Aside>

To connect a DuckDB database to Anyquery, you need to provide the path to the DuckDB database file. Open a shell, and run the following command:

```bash
anyquery connection add
```

The CLI will ask you for:

- a connection name (the schema name to reference the DuckDB database)
- the type of the connection (DuckDB)
- the path to the DuckDB database file (e.g., `/path/to/database.duckdb`). The path can be relative (Anyquery will later save it as absolute) or absolute.
- a filter. It is a CEL script that filters the tables and views to import. For example, to import only the tables that start with `my_`, you can use the following filter: `table.name.startsWith("my_")`. If you don't want to filter the tables, you can leave this field empty. Refer to the [CEL syntax documentation](cel-script) for more information.

Press enter to add the connection. On the next startup, Anyquery will fetch the list of tables and views from the database and import them automatically.

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰! You can now run queries on the tables and views from the DuckDB database. The table name will follow this format `connection_name.[schema_name]_table_name` (e.g. `myduckdb.information_schema_tables`)

```sql
-- Join a table from DuckDB with a table from an API
SELECT * 
FROM duckdb.my_table m
JOIN github_stargazers_from_repository('julien040/anyquery') g
ON m.id = g.login
```

## Additional information

### Functions

When querying a DuckDB database, functions aren't passed to DuckDB. Instead, they are executed in the SQLite database. It might often result in a performance hit. To avoid this, you can create a view in DuckDB that computes the function and then query the view in Anyquery.

### Performance

DuckDB is designed for high performance. While this integration tries to transfer the least amount of data possible, any query that requires a join or a WHERE invoquing a function will result in all the rows transferred to Anyquery, which can be slow. To mitigate this, you can create views in DuckDB that pre-compute the necessary data and then query those views in Anyquery.

### Insert/Update/Delete support

Anyquery cannot insert, update, or delete data in a DuckDB database. For any of these operations, you need to use a DuckDB client. If you want to import Anyquery data into a DuckDB database, you can [export a query result into a JSON file](/docs/usage/exporting-results#json) and then use the DuckDB CLI [to import the JSON file](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/data/json/loading_json#loading-with-the-copy-statement-using-format-json).
