![Query Hub](https://github.com/julien040/anyquery/raw/main/queries/community-repo.png?raw=true)

Sometimes we want to answer a simple data question, but we don't want (or know how) to write the SQL query. The Query Hub is a collection of SQL queries that you can run on your data

For example, let's say you want the count of commits someone made on a Git repository. You could use a community query to get this information.

## Usage

You can find the full extent of the community repository [here](/queries). If you want to suggest a query, feel free to do so [here](https://github.com/julien040/anyquery/discussions/new?category=ideas) or directly open a pull request on the [repository](
    https://github.com/julien040/anyquery/tree/queries).

<LinkCard title="Community repository" href="/queries"

/>

Once you have found a query you want to run, you can use the `anyquery run` command to execute it. Just copy the command and run it in your terminal.

```bash
anyquery run hello_world
```

Anyquery will take care of asking you for the necessary information to run the query.

## Reference

You can find the full documentation of the `anyquery run` command [here](/docs/reference/commands/anyquery_run).
