ChatGPT is a powerful conversational AI model that can generate human-like text. Using Anyquery, it enables you to connect ChatGPT to your local and online applications (such as Spotify, GitHub, Discord, etc.) and interact with them using natural language.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A working installation of Anyquery (`v0.4.0`). Follow the [installation guide](/docs/#installation) if you haven't installed it yet.
- A few integrations set up in Anyquery. Refer to each [integration guide](/integrations) for more information.

## Connect ChatGPT to Anyquery

<Steps>

1. ### Start anyquery locally

    In a terminal, run the following command to connect ChatGPT to Anyquery:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    anyquery gpt
    ```

    This command will start a tunnel to ChatGPT and provide you a bearer token. You must then use this token to authenticate your requests to ChatGPT.

    ```txt title="Terminal" "Your Anyquery ID is ikabcjde"
    julien@MacBook-Air-Julien anyquery % anyquery gpt
    Connecting to the websocket server...
    Connected to the websocket server
                                                                
                                                                
    Anyquery is now running. When asked, pass ikabcjde as     
    the anyquery ID to your LLM client (e.g. ChatGPT,         
    TypingMind, etc.)                                         
                                                                
    ID: ikabcjde                                              
    The tunnel will expire at 2025-05-07 UTC                  
                                                                
                                                                
    Waiting for requests <---<<
    ```

2. ### Set up ChatGPT

    Go to the [Anyquery custom GPT](https://redirect.anyquery.xyz/chatgpt) page and start chatting. When prompted about the Anyquery ID, enter the ID provided in the terminal.
