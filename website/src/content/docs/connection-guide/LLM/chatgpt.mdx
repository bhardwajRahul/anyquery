ChatGPT is a powerful conversational AI model that can generate human-like text. Using Anyquery, it enables you to connect ChatGPT to your local and online applications (such as Spotify, GitHub, Discord, etc.) and interact with them using natural language.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A working installation of Anyquery (`v0.4.0`). Follow the [installation guide](/docs/#installation) if you haven't installed it yet.
- A few integrations set up in Anyquery. Refer to each [integration guide](/integrations) for more information.

## Connect ChatGPT to Anyquery

<Steps>

1. ### Start anyquery locally

    In a terminal, run the following command to connect ChatGPT to Anyquery:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    anyquery gpt
    ```

    This command will start a tunnel to ChatGPT and provide you a bearer token. You must then use this token to authenticate your requests to ChatGPT.

    ```txt title="Terminal" "Your Anyquery ID is ikabcjde"
    julien@MacBook-Air-Julien anyquery % anyquery gpt


    Your Anyquery ID is ikabcjde. This is your bearer token that you must set in chatgpt.com

    ```
