Claude for Desktop lets you talk to LLM models created by Anthropic. Using Anyquery, you can connect Claude Desktop to your local and online applications (such as Spotify, GitHub, Discord, etc.) and interact with them using natural language.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A working installation of Anyquery (`v0.4.0`). Follow the [installation guide](/docs/#installation) if you haven't installed it yet.
- A few integrations set up in Anyquery. Refer to each [integration guide](/integrations) for more information.
- Claude Desktop installed on your machine. You can download it from the [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/download) website.

## Connect Claude Desktop to Anyquery

<Steps>

1. ### Open Claude Desktop
    Open Claude Desktop on your machine.

    Go to the `Developer` panel and click on `Edit Config`. It should show a JSON file in your file explorer. Open the file with your favorite text editor.

3. ### Figure out where anyquery is installed

    Following your installation method, Anyquery can be installed in different locations. You can find the location by running the following command in your terminal:

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="MacOS">
            ```bash title="Terminal"
            which anyquery
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Windows">
            ```bash title="Terminal"
            where anyquery
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux">
            ```bash title="Terminal"
            which anyquery
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Copy the result of this command. You will need it in the next step.

4. ### Update the config file

    Open the JSON file you opened in step 2. You should see a JSON that looks like this:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

    Add a new key to the JSON object with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "anyquery": {
                "command": "path/to/anyquery/that/you/copied/from/step-3",
                "args": [
                    "mcp",
                    "--stdio",
                    // If you want to connect to a particular SQLite database, you can specify it here
                    // "--database",
                    // "path/to/database.db"

                    // Refer to the Anyquery documentation for more options
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Save the file and restart Claude Desktop.

5. ### Ensure Claude Desktop is connected to Anyquery

    Open Claude Desktop, and you should see a small hammer next to a number greater or equal to 3 in the bottom right corner. This indicates that Claude Desktop is connected to Anyquery.
