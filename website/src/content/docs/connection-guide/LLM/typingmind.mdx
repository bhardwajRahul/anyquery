TypingMind is a chat interface for different LLM models. Using Anyquery, you can connect TypingMind to your local and online applications (such as Spotify, GitHub, Discord, etc.) and interact with them using natural language.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A working installation of Anyquery (`v0.4.0`). Follow the [installation guide](/docs/#installation) if you haven't installed it yet.
- A few integrations set up in Anyquery. Refer to each [integration guide](/integrations) for more information.

## Connect TypingMind to Anyquery

<Steps>

1. #### Start Anyquery

    In a terminal, run the following command to start Anyquery:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    anyquery gpt
    ```

    This command will start a tunnel to Anyquery and provide you a bearer token. You must then use this token to authenticate your requests to Anyquery.

2. #### Install the TypingMind plugin

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="TypingMind">
        To connect TypingMind to Anyquery, follow this link:
            [https://redirect.anyquery.xyz/typingMind](https://redirect.anyquery.xyz/typingMind)
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="TypingMind with SetApp">
        To connect TypingMind to Anyquery, follow this link:

        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    and click on the `Import to TypingMind` button. This will install the Anyquery plugin in TypingMind.
