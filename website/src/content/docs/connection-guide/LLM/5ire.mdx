5ire is a chat interface for different LLM models. It supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) 
and can be connected to Anyquery to interact with your local and online applications (such as Spotify, GitHub, Discord, etc.) using natural language.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A working installation of Anyquery (`v0.4.0`). Follow the [installation guide](/docs/#installation) if you haven't installed it yet.
- A few integrations set up in Anyquery. Refer to each [integration guide](/integrations) for more information.


## Connect 5ire to Anyquery

To connect Anyquery to 5ire, you can use the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

<Steps>

1. #### Open 5ire

    Open 5ire on your machine, and open "Tools" in the left sidebar.

    Then, click on "Add" to add a new MCP server.

    Finally, copy the path to the configuration file.

2. #### Locate where Anyquery is installed

    Following your installation method, Anyquery can be installed in different locations. You can find the location by running the following command in your terminal:

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="MacOS">
            ```bash title="Terminal"
            which anyquery
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Windows">
            ```bash title="Terminal"
            where anyquery
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux">
            ```bash title="Terminal"
            which anyquery
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Copy the result of this command. You will need it in the next step.

3. #### Update the 5ire configuration file

    Open the 5ire configuration file you copied in step 1 with your favorite text editor.

    It should look like this:

    ```json
    {
        "servers": [
            // The array can contain multiple servers
        ]
    }

    ```

    Add a new server to the array so that it looks like this:

    ```json
    {
        "servers": [
            // Leave the other servers as they are
            ...
            {
                "key": "anyquery",
                "args": ["mcp", "--stdio"],
                "command": "/path/to/anyquery/that/you/copied/from/step-2",
                "isActive": true
            }
        ]
    }

    ```

4. #### Restart 5ire

    Restart 5ire to apply the changes. You can now use Anyquery with 5ire.

</Steps>


## Usage

Make sure Anyquery is enabled in the tools. You can now interact with your applications using natural language.
