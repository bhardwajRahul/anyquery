            <h1>Privacy Policy for Anyquery’s LLM Integration Feature</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: 2025-01-28</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for using Anyquery (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This
                Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect data
                when you use our integration feature that allows Large Language
                Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to connect to Anyquery and
                request data (“the Feature”). By using the Feature, you agree to
                the collection and use of information in accordance with this
                Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Scope of This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies specifically to the Feature that
                enables LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect to Anyquery. For
                information about how Anyquery handles other data or features,
                please refer to Anyquery’s main Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Developer Information</h2>
            <p>
                Anyquery is developed by:<br />
                • Developer/Publisher: Julien CAGNIART<br />
                • Contact Email: <a href="mailto:contact@anyquery.dev"
                    >contact@anyquery.dev</a
                >
            </p>

            <h2>4. How the Feature Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Operation by Default:</strong> By default, Anyquery
                    runs entirely on your local computer. Your data remains on your
                    system and is never transmitted to external services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Voluntary Tunneling:</strong> If you explicitly enable
                    HTTP tunneling to connect to ChatGPT by using the commands <code
                        >anyquery gpt</code
                    > or <code>anyquery mcp</code>, data relevant to your query
                    will be transferred from your local computer to the
                    tunneling service, and then on to ChatGPT.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ephemeral Transfers:</strong> When you enable the tunneling,
                    Anyquery creates a temporary connection that relays data between
                    your local computer, the tunneling service, and ChatGPT. Anyquery
                    does not store or log this data.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Handling and Retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Data Storage:</strong> Anyquery, by design, does not
                    store or log the data transmitted during the tunneling. Once
                    the data is processed, it is not retained in our systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Logging:</strong> The tunneling service hosted by
                    Anyquery does not log user data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Possible Data Storage by ChatGPT:</strong> When the data
                    is transmitted to ChatGPT (or another LLM), ChatGPT may log or
                    store the data based on its own data retention policies. We recommend
                    reviewing the privacy policy of the LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI’s
                    Privacy Policy for ChatGPT) to understand their data handling
                    practices.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use of the Feature:</strong> You are not required to
                    use the tunneling feature. If you do not enable tunneling, your
                    data remains local and is never transmitted to third-party services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You may terminate or choose not to
                    initiate the tunneling at any time by refraining from using <code
                        >anyquery gpt</code
                    > or <code>anyquery mcp</code> commands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> If you opt to connect
                    Anyquery to ChatGPT or other external LLMs, you acknowledge that
                    their respective privacy policies and terms of service will govern
                    how they handle your data.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Measures:</strong> While we strive to use commercially
                    acceptable means to protect your data during transmission, no
                    method of online transfer is 100% secure. We implement security
                    measures to safeguard data in transit, but we cannot guarantee
                    absolute security.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Minimization:</strong> We limit data transfers to only
                    what is necessary to fulfill the requested query when tunneling
                    is enabled.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Location of Developer:</strong> The developer (Julien CAGNIART)
                is located in France. Depending on your location and the location
                of the LLM service you connect to, your data may be transferred outside
                of your jurisdiction when you enable tunneling.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Intended Audience:</strong> The Feature is not intended for
                use by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect
                personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided
                us with personal data, please contact us.
            </p>
