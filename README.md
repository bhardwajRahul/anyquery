Anyquery is a SQL query engine that allows you to run SQL queries on pretty much anything. It supports querying [JSON](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/querying-files/#json), [CSV](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/querying-files/#csv), [Parquet](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/querying-files/#parquet), SQLite, [Airtable bases](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/airtable/), [Google Sheets](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/google_sheets/), [Notion databases](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/notion/), [logs file](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/querying-log/) using [Grok](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/grok.html), and more. It also supports running SQL queries on [remote files](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/querying-files/#remote-files) (HTTP, S3, GCS) and local apps ([Apple Notes](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/notes/), [Apple Reminders](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/reminders/), [Google Chrome Tabs](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/chrome/), etc.).
It's built on top of [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) and uses [plugins](https://anyquery.dev/integrations/) to extend its functionality.

Moreover, it can acts as a [MySQL server](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/mysql-server/), allowing you to run SQL queries from your favorite MySQL-compatible client (e.g. [Looker Studio](https://anyquery.dev/connection-guide/looker-studio/), [DBeaver](https://anyquery.dev/connection-guide/dbeaver/), [TablePlus](https://anyquery.dev/connection-guide/tableplus/), [Metabase](https://anyquery.dev/connection-guide/metabase/), etc.).

## Usage

The [documentation](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/running-queries) provides detailed instructions on how to run queries with Anyquery.
But let's see a quick example. Type `anyquery` in your terminal to open the shell mode. Then, run the following query:

```sql
-- List all repositories of asg017 related to SQLite
SELECT full_name, stargazers_count, pushed_at FROM github_repositories_from_user('asg017') WHERE name LIKE '%sqlite%';

-- Count rows of a remote 75MB CSV file
SELECT count(*) FROM read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-data/master/latimes-place-totals.csv', header=true);

-- Insert into a Notion database all repositories of nalgeon related to SQLite
INSERT INTO notion_database(repo, stars, last_push) SELECT full_name, stargazers_count, pushed_at FROM github_repositories_from_user('nalgeon') WHERE description LIKE '%sqlite%';

-- Close all tabs of the datasette documentation
DELETE FROM chrome_tabs WHERE url LIKE '%datasette%';
```

You can also launch the MySQL server with `anyquery server` and connect to it with your favorite MySQL-compatible client.

```bash
anyquery server &
mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 8070
```

## Plugins

Anyquery is plugin-based, and you can install plugins to extend its functionality. You can install plugins from the [official registry](https://anyquery.dev/integrations) or create your own. Anyquery can also [load any SQLite extension](https://anyquery.dev/docs/usage/plugins#using-sqlite-extensions).
